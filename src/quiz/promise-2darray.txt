Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.

Order of messages logged:
1.     Sum called ... 
2.     returning from sum
3.     Sum called ... 
4.     returning from sum
5.     sumPromise2 error: Cannot sum an empty array
6.     Adding 1 to sum
7.     Adding 2 to sum
8.     Adding 3 to sum
9.     Adding 4 to sum
10.    Adding 5 to sum
11.    Adding 6 to sum
12.    Adding 7 to sum
13.    Adding 8 to sum
14.    Adding 9 to sum
15.    sumPromise1 sum: 45

The sum2DArray function is a synchronous function that contain a setTimeout that puts the summing 2D array logic
on the asynchronous event queue. Lines 1 and 2 get logged synchronously when sumPromise1 is created and then
lines 3 and 4 are logged subsequently when sumPromise2 is created. Then, sumPromise2 gets synchronously
rejected in line 5 when the sum2DArray function checks if the length of the array is 0. Finally,
lines 6 to 15 are produced when sumPromise2 is resolved and the setTimeout logic is taken off the 
asynchronous event queue and run by the main thread.
